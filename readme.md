## Random R Codes

R is now a large community. Today we have 6,139 R packages. I am planning here to `jot down` the `code snippets` based on the newer packages. The chunk of the codes will be taken either from the Vignette or from the main package documentation pdf. I also like to include stack overflow threads if there are interesting questions. These interesting and easy-to-apply codes will be applied to different data sets to develop models and assumptions.
